# React, Browserify, Babel, Fetch, LevelDB

I would like to try React, Browserify, Babel, Fetch and LevelDB.
ES2015 and new Web Application development style has come.

## Usage

NOTICE: this repository works on node.js v0.12 or io.js. :D

Clone this repository and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Libraries

- `marked` instead of `showdown` because the latter isn't compatible with browserify.
- `whatwg-fetch` (the [proposed](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) for extensible web).
